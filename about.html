        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I like newsletters.
            I like that they&#8217;re emails.
            I like that they stay in my inbox.
            It gets me to actually read them.
            And there&#8217;s a personability, an informality, that is informed by its context.
            I feel like I&#8217;m being written <em>to</em>, rather than <em>for</em>.
            Newsletters, as a format, are rising in popularity, and justifiably so.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days we are writing more than ever.
            Between all the texts, tweets, and emails we send to one another, we&#8217;re writing enough to fill volumes.
            So I wanted to piggy-back on that behavior.
            I also wanted something that captured those positive feelings, but in the opposite direction.
            A newsletter is written by one person and sent to many people.
            What if we could have many writers send their writing all to the same place?
        </p>
        <p>
            I want us all to write about the same thing, to capture the range of voices that surrounds any one subject.
            I want that writing to come naturally.
            I want it to fit into the daily flow, to allow us to sneak some expression into an otherwise utilitarian routine.
            These likes and wants gave rise to this, WriteNow.
            It&#8217;s a way for writers to respond to prompts and then see all the results in one place.
        </p>
        <p>So that&#8217;s what this is and why it exists.</p>
        <p>&mdash; Allan</p>
