        I like newsletters.
        I like that they&#8217;re emails.
        I like that they stay in my inbox.
        It gets me to actually read them.
        And there&#8217;s a personability, an informality, that is informed by its context.
        I feel like I&#8217;m being written <em>to</em>, rather than <em>for</em>.
        Newsletters, as a format, are rising in popularity, and justifiably so.
    </p>
    <p>
        These days we are writing more than ever.
        Between all the texts, tweets, and emails we send to one another, we&#8217;re writing enough to fill volumes.
        So I wanted to piggy-back on that behavior.
        I also wanted something that captured those positive feelings, but in the opposite direction.
        A newsletter is written by one person and sent to many people.
        What if we could have many writers send their writing all to the same place?
    </p>

        I want us all to write about the same thing, to capture the range of voices that surrounds any one subject.
        I want that writing to come naturally.
        I want it to fit into the daily flow, to allow us to sneak some expression into an otherwise utilitarian routine.
        These likes and wants gave rise to this, WriteNow.
        It&#8217;s a way for writers to respond to prompts and then see all the results in one place.
    </p>
    <p>So that&#8217;s what this is and why it exists.</p>
